The general outline of this project was:

1. Collect data from various sources on the internet using webscraping

The four datasets that were used were collected from several different sources, namely OpenWeather, Wikipedia and IBM Cloud Storage, using Webscraping, which was completed with help of the “rvest” and “httr” package in R. These datasets were then saved as four separate CSV files. 

2. Perform data wrangling (standardization and tidying), as well as data exploration



3. Perform predictive analysis using regression models



4. Build a predictive model in order to predict bike rental counts in various cities



5. Build a R Shiny dashboard app with a user friendly UI
